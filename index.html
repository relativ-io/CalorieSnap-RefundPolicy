        <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
        <span class="date">Last Updated: December 27, 2025</span>

        <h2>1. Subscription Services</h2>
        <p>CalorieSnap may offer subscription services (e.g., "Pro" or "Premium" features) on a monthly, annual, or lifetime basis.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Auto-Renewal:</strong> Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period.</li>
            <li><strong>Management:</strong> You can manage and cancel your subscription at any time through your Apple App Store or Google Play Store account settings. Cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing period, and you will retain access to the Premium features until that time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Free Trials</h2>
        <p>We may offer a free trial subscription for service. Unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the free trial, you will be automatically charged a price indicated on the payment screen for a chosen subscription period.</p>

        <h2>3. Price Changes</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to adjust pricing for our service or any components thereof in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion. Any price changes will take effect following email notice to you or notification within the App.</p>

        <h2>4. Refunds</h2>
        <p>Since CalorieSnap is distributed through third-party app stores (Apple App Store and Google Play Store), <strong>we do not have the ability to process refunds directly.</strong> All billing and refund inquiries must be directed to the respective App Store.</p>

        <h3>For iOS (Apple) Users:</h3>
        <p>Refunds are handled exclusively by Apple. We do not have access to your billing information or the ability to issue refunds. To request a refund, you must visit <a href="https://reportaproblem.apple.com" target="_blank">reportaproblem.apple.com</a> and follow Apple's refund procedures. Apple typically grants refunds within 14 days of purchase for valid reasons, but this is entirely at their discretion.</p>

        <h3>For Android (Google Play) Users:</h3>
        <p>Google allows developers slightly more flexibility, but generally, you should request a refund through the Google Play Store within 48 hours of purchase.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Within 48 hours:</strong> You can request a refund directly through the Google Play Store orders page.</li>
            <li><strong>After 48 hours:</strong> If you are past 48 hours and believe there was a technical error or fraudulent transaction, please contact us at <a href="mailto:relativ.sup@gmail.com">relativ.sup@gmail.com</a> with your <strong>Order ID</strong> (starts with GPA), and we will review it on a case-by-case basis. We reserve the right to deny refund requests that do not meet our criteria or are made after a reasonable period.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. One-Time Purchases</h2>
        <p>All one-time purchases (e.g., Lifetime Access) are final and non-refundable, except as required by applicable law. By making a one-time purchase, you acknowledge that you gain immediate access to the digital content and waive any right of withdrawal.</p>

        <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
